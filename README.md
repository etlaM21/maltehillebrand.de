# React App Code for [maltehillebrand.de](https://maltehillebrand.de/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Feel free to look around the code and copy functionality.

However, **you are NOT ALLOWED to publish or distribute any of my work shown in the gallery and homepage grid _(found in folders [public/res/work](public/res/work) and [src/res/work](public/res/work))_.**

## Missing files

To decrease the repo size and only upload to GitHub what is necessary to understand the app's functionality, full-resolution images and videos are not included.
Therefore, the gallery won't be able to load and display media content properly.
